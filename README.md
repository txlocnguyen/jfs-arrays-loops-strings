## Directions to Clone and load in IntelliJ

- Go to this [Repo](https://github.com/DevCoder0x0/jfs-arrays-loops-strings) and FORK this repository onto your github
- Copy the HTTPS URL from the "Code" button on your GitHub
- Open your terminal (Git bash) and navigate to the appropriate location where you wish to save the folder to and run 
```bash 
git clone URL-you-Copied-goes-here
```

- Open IntelliJ and click on new project
- Select Java and make sure you have a Project SDK selected and then click next
  - Leave the box for create project from template unchecked and click next
- Click on three dots ... next to project location. Change project location to the directory you just cloned to your machine. Click OK and then click Finish.

- `MSGrades` will be the entry point for your application.
- Click on the `MSGrades` java file and read thru the comments.
- Anytime you want to test the code right click on `MSGrades.java` the first time and 
  select `Build Module` which should open the Build output and then clicking the green
  hammer will compile future rebuilds
- To run the first time right click on `MSGrades.java` and click `Run MSGrades.main()` 
  which will also open the Run output and then on the Green play button will attempt
  further reruns

## Directions for Coding
- Make all your instance fields private and all your classes and methods public 
- Import the java util ArrayList class module at the top for good practice
- Create 4 ArrayLists instance variables below the teachers Array and make them all private constant(final)
   1. a new instance of a students ArrayList storing strings
   2. a new instance of a math grades ArrayList storing integers
   3. a new instance of a science grades ArrayList storing integers
   4. a new instance of a english grades ArrayList storing integers
<br>

- Inside the class constructor add some students and their grades to the ArrayLists
   1. add two students to the students ArrayList
   2. add two corresponding values for the two students to the math grades ArrayList
   3. add two corresponding values for the two students to the science grades ArrayList
   4. add two corresponding values for the two students to the english grades ArrayList
<br>

- Inside the printStudents public method
   - loop thru the students ArrayList with a For Each loop
     - print each students name on a new line as output
<br>

- Make a method that prints an individual students grades
    - It will be public, not have a return value, and have one int type parameter 
      that is a students index
    - Inside the method:
        - Print the students name by using the index variable to index the students array
        - Print a concatenated string of say "Math: " + and the corresponding grade
          from that ArrayList of grades by index
        - Do this for the next two subjects
        - Total of four output statements
<br>

- Inside the main function before the first two given output statements
  - create a new instance of MSGrades class and store in a variable
    (anything like msGrade8)
  - look up how to print an empty new line for readability
- After
```bash
System.out.println("Middle School Roster");
System.out.println("====================");
```
- invoke or run the printStudents method on our class instance
- Print another empty line if desired for readability
- Use a for loop to loop thru the given teachers array on the class instance
- inside the loop
  - create a new variable that stores the result of "Teacher: " +
    teachers name from the array using the counter variable
  - Print the new variable as output
- After
```bash
System.out.println("\nStudent Grades:\n");
```
- Use a for loop to loop thru students ArrayList on the class instance
- inside the loop
  - pass the counter variable as an index to the printStudentGrades method
    to print each students info
  - Print a new line if you want it to look presentable

## Directions for Pushing Revision to github
- Push your changes up to your repository. From your git bash terminal, enter the following commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m “Adds solutions to activity”
git push -u origin main
```
- Go to your GitHub repository. You should see your changes.
- If you want you can submit a PR to merge changes
<br>

## If you finish early, consider adding some additional functionality. Be original, add some of your own functionality to the application.
